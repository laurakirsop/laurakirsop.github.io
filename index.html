    		<h2>About</h2>
				<p>I'm <a href="http://www.laurakirsop.com">Laura</a> and I've loved the X-files since I was tiny. At various points I've owned X-files t-shirts, a glow in the dark clock, a mouse mat and a map of where all the episodes take place.</p>
				<p>Me and my boyfriend are re-watching the mythology episodes of X-files because they're The Best. Below I'm collating information to keep track of them (my memory is terrible), crossing them off when we've watched them and writing a one line review so I remember each one. AKA I'm the coolest human. I've wanted to make a zine about this for c. 10 years so I guess this is kind of a dream come true.</p>
				<p> The mythology (also called mytharc) refers to a series of episodes in The X-Files that primarily focuses on an overarching story, involving the efforts of Mulder and Scully to investigate and expose the conspiracy to suppress knowledge of the existence of extraterrestrials - <a href="http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Mythology">read more</a>. </p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_The_X-Files#Season_1">Wiki summary</a>: FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) has made a name for himself working on X-Files - unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is appointed a partner in these investigations - Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) - with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. Deep Throat is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.</p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_The_X-Files#Season_2">Wiki summary</a>: Unable to continue his work with Scully, Mulder obtains information about possible extraterrestrial contact in Puerto Rico, finding that the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory is being forcibly closed. Although the pair are later allowed to resume their work, Scully is later kidnapped by an unhinged multiple alien abductee, Duane Barry. Barry takes Scully to a hilltop where she is then abducted, presumably by aliens. She is found comatose at a later date, having mysteriously arrived at a hospital, and recovers several days later. Mulder receives a call from his father, finding out that his sister Samantha (Megan Leitch), who had been abducted as a child, has returned. Samantha is being pursued by a shapeshifting bounty hunter, who is assassinating human clones. Samantha is killed, although it is revealed that she was simply one of a number of clones, produced using alien tissue to create an alien-human hybrid.</p>

			<p>The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a successful attempt by a friend of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. However, Soona is later assassinated, and the downloaded files are found to be written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) - a Navajo man capable of translating the files - Mulder is shown a box-car full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed.</p>

			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology_of_The_X-Files#Season_3">Wiki summary</a>: Mulder is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Her sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw), however, is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in hospital that night. Investigating evidence of an alien autopsy, Mulder infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien-human hybrid. Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X (Steven Williams). X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by Scully. Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder (Don S. Williams), who claims during her abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.</p>

			<p>The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a World War II-era submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns - except for one, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The oil is controlling the crewman's body, and after passing through several hosts, has taken over Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), who Mulder has been pursuing. Scully finds that the submarine had been involved in discovering the oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.</p>
